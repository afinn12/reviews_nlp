• "Perfect for floating ~ tying to a boat when docked, going down a fast river!"

• "Hit some pretty rough water at parts and did not pop the tubes."
• "at the state park!<br />  So bought two more this year for grand daughters to use & a friend bought 3"

• "I have probably tried 15 rafts in three years, and the River Run is the best value."

• "Can't wait to use this thing all the time next summer, when I'll be legal to drink and have a good drunken time."
• "Bottom mesh is strong and not only keeps you cool on a hot day, but also allows you to keep shoes, shirt, etc. in the bottom without losing it."
• "One of them was clearly leaking out of the vale."
• "The only con I have is that the cooler in the center between the two seats, when its completely full of air, drinks and ice and your sitting in the tube (which sinks a little from your body weight) its too high for you to see the person you sharing the tube with!"
• "2.. The head rest... whoever invented this thing should get a noble peace prize, no sore neck, or being stuck staring up at the sky the whole time."

• "I purchased 3 of these last summer and had nothing but PURE FUN using them."
• "a bit tricky to make the stopped seat so it does not deflate easily."
• "no holes yet after about 5 fairly rough trips down the river."
• "Don't spend more on \\"heavy duty\\" tubes, no matter what you'll eventually get leaks and these are cheap enough to replace."
• "The tube itself is still usable but disappointed that it no longer has the mesh bottom."
• "After the second time the mesh insert ripped out from both of them...i guess you get what you pay for"
• "I'm seriously considering purchasing another."
• "Really annoying when it is a defect."
• "This is the first pool float that actually feels tough enough to use tubing."
• "These are very nice and comfortable river tubes, but I have six and 4 of them have more or less slow leaks that I have trouble finding."
• "Had no trouble going over rocks."
• "After about 30 minutes it was nearly empty."
• "I used it for four days, so far no holes."
• "It's still functional, but the hole is so wide that I have to arrange myself in an awkward position to make it work."
• "If you do not like the mesh bottom you can cut it out without damaging the tube."
• "It wasn't worth the money I spent."
• "But i think the newer versions are slightly weaker."
• "The cup holder is a must for a lazy day floating down the river."
• "So, while there wasn't a leak, if I hadn't had a friend with the sealant, it wouldn't have worked."
• "I have seen far worse items in this price range.<br"
• "First ordered two and when I inflated it one did just fine but the other lost air slowly over a few hours."
• "But I have never had any other tube survive this type of punishment!"
• "The only thing i would say is i do not like the change in pattern."
• "On river even when water in river was low."
• "Some people have reported problems with seams; however, most are having trouble with leaking valves."
• "It bumped and slid over rocks and bounced off some tree limbs with no issues."
• "Also would recommend getting a electric air inflation unit to pump up the these tubes and to suck air out of them when done using."
• "The defective one was about 20% full an hour later, just sitting in the living room."
• "I have been careful to avoid any serious rapids in the tubes as I am unaware of how it might handle bigger water."
• "But will not buy another kind!"
• "but I have no experience with that."
• "Bumped into some rocks and branches along the way with no problems due to the thick material."
• "This tube feels durable enough for the small rapids on the lower American River."
• "thing I will mention is that if you are filling them up with your own lungs, make sure you don't have sunblock on your hands as unscrewing the valve (of which one smaller valve cap is screwed into the larger valve) is nigh on impossible.<br /><br />Otherwise"
• "Not very surprisingly, a bunch of people were tubing that same day and so I wasn't allowed into the park and had to go through another park's entrance."
• "Essentially lost its shape in about 10 minutes."
• "Also to note: inflating these is a little tricky."
• "The two river runs i received might be from a bad batch but the hassle and expense of returning the defective products is not likely worth it."
• "Used it a lot and had no problems..."
• "I was worried it would be torn as I have seen happen to many floaties."
• "The valve was leaking like some other reviews had said was a common problem."
• "The river was a little low when I went and at some parts, it got down to only about 3\\" deep."
• "The only problem was that one of them had a slow leak and I had to blow it up every so often ."
• "Shoot the Hooch in the River Run 1."
• "Wrap the white tape around the threads two times and screw the valve back in tightly."
• "The pillow is lower on this one and you are almost laying totally flat when you are in it."
• "I ordered four, and of those, one leaked straight out of the box."
• "I was hesitatant to purchase but read many of the previous reviews and decided for $13 each what do I have to lose except $26."
• "Hey, it was not perfect"
• "Loses a little air overnight"
• "Even the vinyl tube with some kind of heavy sleeve and coating are not safe for rivers and lakes."
• "Never had any rips or tears or any problems for that matter!"
• "It also made it hard to paddle."

• "1/2 hour into float the seam around cup holder leaked air."
• "It has a leak in it."
• "This was a disappointment since 1 of 2 was faulty."
• "Only problem was that I got a couple defective ones (mesh netting fell out, warped cap insertion hole), but Amazon replaced them immediately.<br /><br />Comes"
• "Two others in the group had the same product and didn't have the same problem."
• "I miss it every single day..."
• "The price is almost the same as going down the Salt River with a terrible black tire tube."
• "Purchased the River Run Sport Lounge, inflated it, and within two hours of it being in the pool with no one in it, I noticed that the attached mesh bottom was no longer attached halfway around the bottom."
• "The problem is 1 of them has 2 pin holes near the seam and it leaks air."
• "It hadn't rained for at least a week, so the river was low."
• "Grabbed the raft and it was low on air already."
• "Inflated it and dumped it in the creek."
• "With the name &#34;River Run&#34; its totally misleading because you'll end up deflated in minutes and is NOT IDEAL FOR RIVER TUBING!."
• "No neck cramps with those."
• "One tube has a slow leak but the tubes do come with a repair kit."

• "A little disappointing for what you pay for these things."
• "Voice isn't annoying, and the classical music is refreshing in a world of irritating midi tones and catchy jingles."
• "It won't keep a baby occupied for long, but the low price justifies it's purchase."

• "The toy will go crazy when the batteries are low."
• "It yells out colors when no one is pressing any of the buttons or anywhere near it!"

• "/>One of the arms is no longer working despite the fact that this toy gets minimal play.<br"

• "The head of the octopus contains a big heavy sound box with a horrible velcro flap on the back to let you change the languages etc."

• "though, the button for the color red stopped working."
• "It is cute, but I'm very disappointed it didn't last longer!"
• "It feels cheap and it's actually kinda boring."
• "Unfortunately, not only is it so sensitive that it randomly speaks, sometimes without being touched, but it often says the wrong color."

• "(by that i mean shake his body around)"
• "The quality seems very poor compared to usual Baby Einstein products."

• "No problems; seems to be well put together."
• "New batteries didn't help, and both sets of batteries showed to be working when tested."
• "I emailed customer service for KidsII and told them about the problem."
• "Oh, and I hate the music."
• "That said, I'm very sad that some of the pronunciations are wonky and the word for orange in Spanish is anaranjado, not naranja (which does mean orange, but orange as in the fruit)."

• "This dumb thing did even last 6 months."
• "It was an ok toy for the price, despite it's flaw :)"

• "The colors only worked for a couple of months then it just stopped working, the music still works."
• "Instead is it some horrible scratchy artificial fabric."
• "What I don't care for is that if you don't turn it off when it isn't in use it goes off by itself."

• "I ordered this game to be played with young children,  It works well that there really is no need to wait for turns and simple to use."

• "Only complaint is that the cup holders can't fit a can while it's in a coozie, which is a bit inconvenient, but overall not a big deal."
• "Their customer service is awful."
• "Not well made - you actually slide off of it."
• "You end up lying down."
• "One issue I don't like is that the &#34;pontoons&#34; used to keep in a sitting posion move out and have to be repositioned or the lounge will recline back slightly."
• "The chair has been blown up for less than a month and the left arm has torn off at the seam"
• "Now that the pool is open and it's inflated, there is a leak."
• "Disappointed that the color was not as shown."
• "All in all, even with the warning that the unit (Toy?) is intended for adult usage exclusively, I suspect that children and perhaps very limber young adults are the only ones who would find climbing on and off the float an enjoyable task."
• "Bought the product in July of 2014 ... used it for one month in 2015 and the seam came apart leaving the product useless."
• "The only complaint I have is that the cup holders have basically collapsed in on themselves and the only thing you can get in there is a smaller glass bottle (standard beer bottle) with a little force."
• "Last weekend one of them got a slow leak around where you inflate it at so no way to fix or patch."
• "Bought 2, 1 had a split seam after a couple months that was hard to patch due to location."
• "Maybe other people are getting a different item, no idea.<br /><br"
• "Somehow the rest of the float survived, but at that point, it's difficult to maintain your balance when sitting on it."
• "Only reason for not giving 5 stars to all is it sit high above the water."
• "Used this for a lazy river float this past week-end."
• "Got to use the last one about 10 days before it broke."

• "If you can get yourself balanced just right, and don't have any children in your pool causing waves you can use it without the arms but not very easily."
• "The handle can take a lot of pull so it won't rip off....highly recommend this item"
• "It lasted two seasons use by adults (i.e., no rough treatment)."
• "The just need to angle the bottom of the holder so that it's flat when the chair is inflated and then nothing would spill unless someone jumped on the chair or otherwise seriously angled it in some way.<br /><br"

• "I just get on it near the ladder and no problems."
• "Not recommended for when you first go out in the sun."

• "I have been using this Intex floating lounge for three seasons now and I can't recommend them enough."
• "Can't wait to enjoy it this Summer."
• "This is not a toy but a great alternative to those bulky solid floats as this deflates easily using the vacume to suck the air out."
• "Inflating it for the 2015 season, after using it in 2013 and 2014, the seams on both arms have split at the same point exposing an obvious weakness in manufacturing."
• "One might have a small  leak, not sure."
• "This is not easy to keep in the sitting position."
• "Bought 2 for Fathers day gifts both had the same problem otherwise just ok seating but a bit unbalanced."

• "The only problem is getting everybody off of it cause' it was so comfy."
• "I like the white but bet it will get really dirty"
• "Couldn't wait to float the day away, but no sooner did I get into the water and the U-shaped 'arm' lost air!"
• "After a couple of months, one of the armrest came completely detached from the float."
• "Also as someone else has mentioned the drinks holder shape changes when you sit in it, so might stop some drinks fitting in it.<br /><br"
• "So, I haven't used this chair yet because unless you have an electric pump, you're likely screwed trying to inflate it."
• "After the first use, the nozzle plug would not stay in place, and air would leak out."
• "Not sure where it came from."
• "I believe it is due to the back of the arms not being connected and the back of the seat falling back which causes the arms to push outward putting stress on the seam."
• "The only issue I had was once blown up, the cup holders seem to take on an oval shape and make it hard to put cups in or bottles."
• "No Boston Valve, it takes a long time to inflate and deflate."
• "The info on the WEB that says two air chambers is incorrect and misleading."
• "This float is durable and holds the air, unlike a very pricey float that I bought last year that had a leak from the start."
• "Can't really use it without the arms being inflated because it's unstable."
• "Have had no issues with the float in its first season of use."
• "no problems so far will post if i find one"

• "Was very good whe I did the return but not satisfied with this float."
• "Intex has bad quality products."
• "I would not recommend this."
• "it was a bad choice of buying two as well."
• "Oh, and had a 270+ lb. person on it a few times and it handled it no problem, so no concerns with whoever said it had a 250 lb weight limit."
• "There has been one negative which I must mention."
• "Even when it was attached, the armrest would come out from behind the back of the float and it would no longer recline."
• "The old style of colors got 5 stars, these not so good."
• "But the Cup holders bent into a weird shape - not round any more, kinda oval."
• "Very disappointed with the quality."
• "Once torn, the lounger becomes useless for anything other than jetsam."
• "The raft still worked but was not stable since the handles are on the arm."
• "not worth the cost .also the chair does not sit up,it is more a flat float once you get in it.."
• "/>no, a koozie will not fit."
• "Very large and very difficult to get into."
• "It isn't Amazon, it was the company, I also bought an inflatable mattress from them that didn't last long at all."
• "This is great for Tahoe where the water never gets above 68 degrees but if you are in a warmer climate and want to have part of you wet or in the water then this chair might not be your best choice.a warmer climate and want to have part of you wet or in the water then this chair might not be your best choice."
• "Instead one arm broke off 1 week after and the other the second week."
• "I had no fear of it spilling or falling out.<br /><br"
• "It is being touted as a toy"
• "However it does seem to lose air a little faster than I though it would."
• "Warning, make sure you have a serious air pump-"
• "I don't know why Amazon catagorizes this lounger as a toy for this review, but it's nothing like the cheap $[...] flat floats that you find in discount stores like [...]."
• "you're looking for a floating device that keeps you completely out of the water, look no more."
• "Not a fan at all of this new version."
• "BUT... on FIRST use and within hours of inflating a slow leak became apparent."
• "High quality vinyl, durable, tough and thick."
• "You can do those things, but you'll have your arms up a bit awkwardly which might make them ache (it does for me)."
• "Too bad as the lounges were nice."
• "Even more annoying is that I can not tell from the picture which model it is."
• "One arm ripped away with hardly any pressure."
• "The bottle holder fails to keep shape after a two-three months and air starts leaking at around 4-5 months.<br />We keep buying this unit because the price is right, should the price go up above $30, we'll switch to a different unit.<br />So"
• "It is hard to get on."
• "Nothing exciting going on, just sitting in the pool and bam, the main portion popped a seam and it was done."
• "The only problem with it is the arms."
• "very nice to just in and read with out fear of falling out of it a little hard to get into ."
• "I would like to have returned this but must have just missed the window."
• "But that is quite deceiving because once you try to sit on it in the water it is nothing but an overpriced piece of garbage."
• "One thing no cup holders  you get a 3 pack of Palm tree ,ducks,flamingos on Amazon for 12.00."
• "Already trashed the box, so can't return the product.  Bummer."
• "I bought one of these and have just bought 2 more because everyone fights over who gets to use it!!"
• "So i dont recommend to anybody."
• "In any case, it was a complete waste of money & time."
• "However, once you inflate this float the drink holders become oval-shaped instead of round that makes it a little more difficult to place your containers in it."
• "The glued on arm peeled right off the main seat and is now worthless."
• "It's sturdy and well made - not the kind that you use for a season and then pitch -- we'll be using this again this year and probably years further."
• "Product worked/works fine, takes a lot to make it stop."
• "The only problem I have with the entire lounges is that the cup holders are &#34;quite shallow&#34; and have lost there round shape (design) due to the Florida heat."
• "I purchased two of these.love 1 hate the other."
• "Can't say enough good things about this!"
• "Bad design where the arms, which are supposed to hold it upright, just split apart and it becomes a flat lounge."
• "When you lean back in the Lounge chair the blue sides separate and doesn't support the back at all."
• "bothers e is that the picture and description describe the older much bigger version."
• "It sits a little high in the water so I was worried about being able to get on."
• "Not sure why its listed as a toy."
• "Didn't come with a patch and I still cant find where the leak is coming from but it's possibly a seam which will be difficult to patch."
• "You are so high that it's a little difficult to row yourself back to where you want to be.<br />* Sit N Float will keep you in touch with the water."
• "A wooden paddle may be useful for this purpose, but none was supplied and no storage area provided."
• "The only problems I have noted is that it is hard for some people to get on it ."
• "Well, I've had this float for 2 months and it has developed a leak."
• "Storage is also a problem, it's odd shape makes it hard to store unless it remains outside uncovered."
• "thats the tricky part, but once you're on, you won't want to get off!"
• "why is you don't want to get off."
• "Its just a tiny bit uncomfortable."

• "It has been blown up for 4 days now and no air leakage."
• "I found the leak and it is in the seam the connects the arms to the body of the float."
• "One caveat - it's not easy to blow up and I can't imagine doing it by mouth."
• "/>Be mindful of the weight limits on floating devices, I suspect those that have broken, sink or lose air are being used by people who are too heavy."
• "I have used it just once in this summer and no problem occurred."
• "but this new design is useless for an adult attempting to sit in an upright position."
• "It works great and withstood the entire summer without popping, but it does keep you sitting high, so if it's really hot out, then it's not the best."
• "Kind of a pain to use."
• "When I ordered this floating lounge recliner I wasn't sure how it would work."
• "The dual cup holders are convenient, but a bit small for a drink can with a cozy... a drink can alone fits fine."
• "It helps to have a mini-compressor plugged into your car cigarette lighter outlet to blow it up, but it can be done by \\"air power\\"  Just more difficult."
• "It is quite large so not good for a small pool."
• "If I can find one thing wrong, it's that the drink holders don't really work."
• "This is the most uncomfortable lounger I have aver purchased but impossible to return because it is so difficult to deflate"
• "I'm going to keep it just b/c the price is right and it's just not worth it to send it back."
• "I like the float, we've ordered them before, but the one I got this time has a slow leak in it."
• "Maybe it's because I'm a bit of a chunky muffin but the struggle to get on it was real."
• "/>Overall for a pool float that I expect to last a season or two of hard use, the price and quality seem adequate.<br /><br"
• "It is not easy for older people to get on in deep water."

• "Once actually on it you feel as if you are on top of the Pillsbury dough boy...hard to maneuver and even with its large size, slightly unstable."
• "The newer 3 chamber model is worthless  - the two arm chambers separate in back and don't hold the back up."
• "However, if you don't have enough air in them, the lounger is not stable in the water."
• "It proved more resilient than the other Intex chairs - this one lasted one month to the day before one of the arms developed an irreparable leak and had to be cut off."
• "The cup holder isn't the greatest because it doesn't stay in a circular position but over all it got the job done."
• "I've had it for 2 weeks now and use it almost everyday and no issues."
• "I never use the cup holders, but just the fact they're warped after a couple days of use bothers me."
• "The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that it rides high on the water."

• "This has been redesigned so the back is not totally supported."
• "I have had surgery and never got a chance to return it ..."
• "Even hit some rock, trees, and branches and no problems."
• "Really do not like the chair and the way it is designed."
• "When people come over to swim everyone fights over this raft."
• "Keep in mind you will be above the water in this, so if you want a float that lays low in the water so you stay wet, do not get this one."
• "Terrible now, looses air quicker, much smaller, and less stable than older model."
• "I was a little weary when purchasing cause of the ripping seams."
• "but it should last more than a month..piece of crap."
• "The weak points are where the arm rests are molded into the recliner portion."
• "EVERY ONE WAS FIGHTING TO GIVE IT A TRY."
• "When it arrive I noticed that the arm rest portion that also goes around the back was no longer one piece but split in the back so that the arm rests do not connect as ion previous models.<br"
• "didnt relize the pool was missing something till these arrived"
• "I bought two of these both were missing the patch kits that are supposed to come with them, other then that seems fine."

• "I bought this before at Costco and the arms broke off just like the reviews say."
• "Very hard to get in and out of."
• "But with the comfort, I just say to Hell with the handles and cup holders."
• "Cup holders get a little distorted after being blown up, but you can still force a bottle/can into them, not a big deal."
• "I bought 2 more through Amazon since Costco no longer carries them and the 2 arrived slightly different than the description."
• "The weakest point is the connection between the body of the float and the arms."
• "NOT LIKE THE OLD DESIGN!"
• "Unfortunately, this chair doesn't meet those expectations."
• "Bought 2, 3 years ago, and sadly had to replace them."
• "Hard to get into or out of."
• "It is not good for reclining."
• "and it still is withstanding 2 months of abuse."
• "I don not recommend this if you are over a size 12."
• "issue I see is that it is hard to get into the lounge."
• "It was difficult to inflate this pool lounge."
• "It never deflates either...the only thing negative about it is that sometimes i like to lay out completely flat"
• "SO be warned, it IS bulky and takes a lot of air to inflate!"
• "I got on the Intex Floating Recliner Lounge and it SUCKS!"
• "The main air chamber is centered between 2 arm-rest-style air chambers, however, since the two arms are NOT attached in the back of the lounger behind the upright back, as soon as an adult leans back to LOUNGE, the back of the center chamber slides down between the 2 arms and lies flat on the water, while the arms are pushed out to either side."
• "Don't want to get off once I'm floating."
• "I'm hesitant to buy another one"
• "But it is pretty annoying to pay for a product that was already defective."
• "I dont ever want to be with out one!"
• "Well I can attest that it only takes a medium sized adult to roll off the side and the arms tear off immediately, its a very poor vinyl weld."
• "One arrived with a leak."
• "For anyone over 200# the floats separate and the recliner dumps you backwards into the water.<br />Also, the cup holders deformed almost immediately!"
• "This is a large lake with granite sand beaches (very rough on feet and anything inflatable) and these chairs have taken three years of heavy use with no problems."
• "So glad I ordered 2 so there is no fighting for this one."
• "Others did not like it either!"
• "Very difficult to get on."
• "The blue sides floats with the cup holders are not one piece like the old design."
• "No jumping or abuse to note.<br /><br"
• "Very well made just not great for the river or deep waters."
• "It does what is supposed to do, not better than others!"
• "I also have a $100 pontoon-style chair that I bought last year; however, the seating is already very worn and bleached out."
• "Could slip while trying to get on and get injured."
• "Unfortunately, I think it was thrown out before I could ask for a refund or get it exchanged."
• "Too much a pain to send it back."
• "Next and equally annoying is that the \\"cup holders\\" built into the arms, are small, oval and not user friendly."
• "Only one complaint, the cup holder needs to be positioned more on top of the arm of the floater, because when a glass {plastic of course} is inserted its wants to tilt to the inside, and the holder becomes oval, rather than round, making it difficult to insert glass."
• "I really like this floating recliner; it's extremely comfortable to relax in the pool on, but unfortunately, it slowly loses air and has to be refilled after a few hours."
• "Great lounge but a little difficult  to get on."
• "Not very happy with the product."
• "I'm going to order another one to prevent any more fighting over the chair!"
• "/>We very much dislike the product.<br />Not recommended at all"
• "very poor design if a \\"recliner\\"  cannot be reclined in."
• "I have the smaller 13k gal. pool, and these floats almost hide the water."
• "No Megala Mart Frosty here folks...."
• "The BLACK colored area got so hot from the sun that it was uncomfortable to the touch."
• "and again no problem.<br /><br"
• "If I didn't have children pretending to be mermaids & doing \\"underwater fighting\\", I could probably take a nap in it."
• "This defect makes it almost impossible to be seated in the middle as it leans to one side."
• "Unfortunately, I have not had the pleasure of using the floating recliner, but this is the second time I have bought them as gifts."
• "It just got hot and was not a chair for relaxing IN the water."
• "Not sure if getting onto the raft from deep water as I plopped on from boat swim platform."
• "I sit well above the water and I don't feel like I'm going to crush the thing."
• "I bought two, and one of them has a VERY slow leak, like once a week I have to put a little air in it to tighten it up kind of slow, and the cup holders turned to an oval shape which makes it difficult to but a can or bottle in,  otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
• "What a waste of money"
• "Hard to get on and once you do don't move because it will buck you off."
• "If you dont want to be in the pool at all this is the inflatable chair for you."
• "I have two grandsons 6 & 10 who play on this and it takes theis abuse well."
• "This almost ensures early collapse of your float."
• "After that the arm rest seal leaked then completely gave way  would not recommend this product to anyone."
• "I bought two more because of the new design since the bottom half was the part that usually got dirty."
• "When inflated it doesn't quite fit in the car hah."
• "The arms are not attached to the back (behind it), allowing them to slide out from under the back, thus losing the support behind you and rendering the armrests useless in the process as well."
• "It was part of a Father's Day gift, so imagine the disappointment."
• "The down side is that you are limited to only getting sun on your front."
• "However, I was dead wrong."
• "It keeps you completely above the water for those days when you want to float away your stress without getting soaked."
• "I bought this recliner at a local store, not on Amazon"
• "Fearing this, I bought a \\"competitor\\" the adjustable reclining lounge, which I also reviewed."
• "However, it does take awhile to pump up, so is a bit of a pain if it is something you want to travel on."
• "I was so tired of purchasing pool floats that lasted only for the season."
• "No packaging slip or return info inside, and a small piece of paper with repair instructions suggested there's supposed to be a repair kit, but there's not."
• "but I hate getting in the cold lake water at the beginning of summer."
• "As far as durability, 2 months into the season the arm parts tore a hole in them and I had to cut the blue part off."
• "I could stay in this thing all day if there were no interruptions, but alas, the real world always does."
• "Only used it 2 times before the seams where the arms attach to the main float ripped.  Do not recommend"
• "The price is ridiculously cheap for what you get."
• "Get your air pressure lower than you thnk you need, as this beast does not need to be filled all the way."
• "Two of the four I bought broke where the arm is attached."
• "But not for anyone who isn't flexible since it is hard to get on cause it is so high"
• "If you don't happen to have one already for something else, you're going to likely pay almost as much for the pump as you did for the chair (not included with chair)."
• "It is really big and hard to get into, don't think I would order again."
• "lounge itself is of poor design: the inflatable arms wrap around the back and are not secured in place, thereby constantly being pushed out and away from the lounger and from each other in the back - requiring constant adjustment to keep you seated in the right position.<br />The"
• "Broke on the seam after 5 days of lite use."
• "Not comfortable and you do not get wet at all."
• "there are alot of reviews on this some bad some good...."
• "Has held a variety of overweight (one well over 300) people with no problem or sign of wear, even after being accidentally left in the sun every now and then."
• "If it loses any air, it won't stay up."
• "Sometimes, you just don't want to be soaking in the pool."
• "I am really not satisfied with this product and I cost a lot of money too."
• "I got this because I'm seriously sick of have floats that you end up being half in the water in."
• "I certainly have no problem recommending it."
• "Ultimately, it took room in the car and I never got to use it due to its inability to hold air."
• "materials used are of poor quality and develop holes easily."
• "A Tervis tumbler won't fit."
• "It wasn't worth fixing as it is a difficult spot to patch."
• "I have a bad knee & it was a little hard to get on the first time, but now I have figured it out & it is a cinch & I am hooked."
• "Anxious to get them in the pool."
• "Sadly both or them ripped off fairly easily with normal use, which renders the chair not very useful."
• "Both compartments were deflated, but there were no visible holes or tears."

Product Title: The Resistance (The Dystopian Universe)
Product Name: The Resistance (The Dystopian Universe)

Positive Features:
• "A random group of people might be ok, but you have to be paying attention and there's a lot of talking and deducing that is involved."
• "thing to watch for, though: if you play with the max 10 players, using the &#34;basic&#34; rules, there seems to be a disadvantage against the &#34;Resistance&#34; (blue cards) and in favor of the &#34;spies&#34; (red cards)."
• "special power cards grant a lot of replay-ability.<br /><br"
• "But this really gives you a good framework and story to get into and everyone has a goal to accomplish of sorts.<br /><br"
• "I've played a few times now and each time I was a spy."
• "There are a ton of truly great games for smaller groups of players, but for the 5-10 player range, nothing even comes close to The Resistance."
• "Any time there is a chance of five or more people in the same room, I bring it."
• "You can tell a game is good when new players buy the game shortly after playing it the first time and I know of at least 10 people who have."
• "Allows you to practice your logic skills as well as your ability to fib and catch someone else who isn't telling the truth."
• "The resistance wins by completing 3 missions, while the spies win by failing 3 missions out of a total of five missions.<br />The game begins by randomly passing out player cards of either resistance fighters or spies."
• "Play it with your long-time friends and learn who can truly bluff their way around you!"
• "It was marvelous fun indeed."
• "This is a great bluffing game and lots of fun with a big group of friends (7-8 ideal but 5-10 are all good too)."
• "I first saw Resistance on TableTop (search for it on YouTube if you don't know what it is), and it looks fun."
• "If you're looking for a good family game, buy Settler's of Catan or Power Grid instead."
• "This game does require at least 5 players, do keep that in mind as well!"
• "The players on the mission anonymously vote for the success/failure of said mission-- now here's the catch: only spies may place a &#34;failure&#34; card into play."
• "After seeing it on Tabletop, I was DYING to play this game and finally bought it.<br /><br />The"
• "Lots of fun would recommend for anyone."
• "If you like this game and are thinking of purchasing, I would recommend getting Avalon, which is the same game but with more characters and roles."
• "That issue might be resolvable by using the &#34;extra&#34; rules that are featured as an option, which I have yet to try.<br /><br"
• "Then, there's a diminutive rulebook that is both well-written and easy to understand."
• "It is incredibly easy to pick up, has endless replay value with or without the free expansion that is included, and best of all, everyone who plays, is ACTUALLY playing!"
• "Never have I had so much fun in a room of people yelling at each other."
• "It encourages a great deal of effective bluffing and a fair amount of strategy bundled up in a fast and fun mini-package."
• "Its easy for the traitors to win but one mistake can cost you the game."
• "The game is a LOT of fun."
• "/>This is a party game."
• "This game is easy to learn and teach to others."
• "the leader chooses agents for the mission, all players must vote to accept them."
• "I think it's great marketing, and don't find it to be seedy like much marketing is."
• "Fun to play with a large group...  simple mechanics..  easy to teach.."
• "That being said, the game is usually fun even when you lose."
• "If you have cerebral friends that do not like to interact during their gameplay, this won't be for them, nor anyone else."
• "This is a fantastic game of hidden identities and team play."
• "It's great trying to outwit your friends while trying not to get hoodwinked yourself."
• "ONLY flaw to this game, is that it requires FIVE people to play it."
• "This game is good, but Avalon is better."
• "This is a fantastic game to play in large groups, whether friends or family."
• "/>It's one of the best games I've ever played and I'd recommend it to anyone."
• "This is handled by the player in the dealer position, which rotates per round, choosing a group of people to go on the mission, and then all players vote to agree on that squad.<br /><br"
• "However, I recommend Battlestar Galactica or Bang!"
• "Will quickly turn into a favorite!"
• "/>Tip: make up fun story lines about the missions."
• "Acquaintances is the perfect type of people to play this with."
• "Still this is a great group game for 5-10 who like improvisation and thinking on your feet."
• "The game is easy to learn and fantastic to plot out and have a blast trying to pin down who the spies are."
• "It’s fun, and it’s all about interaction."
• "you might not look at your friends the same way after this game!!"
• "Its not well balanced as far as spies vs rebels(small games rebels have advantage, big game spies have advantage) but it doesn't matter because its so fun."
• "It played well both times."
• "Its very easy to pick up."
• "Still, the genre itself is a little limited as to how many times it can be played before the concept simply loses its fun."
• "This is a great game."
• "This game can be loads of fun if you play with the right people."
• "A group of freedom fighters (the players) are trying to fight back against the system oppressing them (think of the rebels in Star Wars)."
• "Its fun the first time and has only got more interesting."
• "basically, it depends on if the people you play with get into it."
• "The good guys are trying to figure out which ones are spies, which leads to a bunch of yelling, mud slinging, and distrust of your friends that can sometimes last for days."
• "Keep in mind that with 8 to 10 people it is a bit to handle at first but with the plot thickens expansion in the box makes it is a lot more interesting without a lot of added depth."
• "Some friends are easy to tell who is bad and some are not."
• "I had played this game before, so I decided to purchase it."
• "Although you can play with up to 10 and as few as 5, the best number is around 7."
• "Really, truly the most fun you can have while still losing."
• "(La Pallottola!), and that may be a good way to feel out how your group likes figuring out who's who in a game, but still having card game mechanics to play should that not interest them."
• "The only caveat I have to that is make sure you're playing with the right people- people who know that it is just a game and won't take it personally."
• "very easy to learn.<br />Poker"
• "Repeated plays also make the later games far more interesting, as you can start to get a better understanding of how players react to different situations.<br /><br />Pros:<br />small box, easy transportation<br />works"
• "Be prepared for hours of entertainment."
• "The spies know what team every player is on, the members of the resistance only know their own loyalty and through the game have to weed out the spies in their group in order to pass three of five missions.<br /><br"
• "The Resistance is a great strategy cooperative card game."
• "This game is hard to play because you need a lot of people to play it....  for hours."
• "For me, this is 90% of the fun of Battlestar Galactica in 10% of the time."
• "You need at least five to play!<br /><br />For larger groups this game works great."
• "The Resistance is by far the best social and bluffing game that I have run across."
• "It arrived in great shape!"
• "and it's already gotten 15+ plays!"
• "Once the party is selected for the mission all the members of the party vote on failure or success of the mission."
• "Very strategic and great group dynamic."
• "I didn't realize how much of a hit this game would actually be when I played it."
• "It's rare to find a game that entertains any group of friends."
• "Very fun game, lots of talking and laughing."
• "If you're not familiar with the game, it's a very simple, relatively quick party game in the same vein as Mafia or Werewolves - between 5 and 10 players are divided into two factions, one of which is secret."
• "For instance, in a five player game there would be three loyal resistance fighters and two treacherous spies."
• "Will Wheaton was carrying on about playing as spies and the government and voting, and I skipped it."
• "It is very easy to learn the rules, and while the game seems simple at first, as you play more, you find more and more depth in the interactions and in how to extract critical information from people.<br /><br"
• "If the resistance isn't clever enough, one or two spies will elude them long enough to get voted on in the later missions and the spies will win the game.<br /><br"
• "Extremely fun game, easy to learn and teach to others"
• "It adds a little fun to the game.<br /><br />In"
• "If you're familiar with Werewolf, I'd say it's better for the following reasons:<br /><br"
• "I enjoy it and recommend you give it a go if you have large groups."
• "your group of friends like mafia/werewolf themed games then getting this game is a no-brainer."
• "Unless you have a good poker face!"
• "It's also inexpensive and light on components, so don't be worried about taking it on vacation or to a bar for game night where spillage is a possibility."
• "It's easy to get into and definitely more fun than one would expect."
• "This is a fun little game under $20."
• "This can be a big part of the fun, but I so often found myself going in circles of logic only to find that in most cases, all I had to go on was gut instinct, and sometimes it was just unsatisfying."
• "And the gameplay honestly doesn't require larger materials."
• "Couples should be aware of this before starting the game.<br />-The theme of being a team of revolutionaries in what looks like a dystopian future may turn some people off, though the theme is not very emphasized in the actual playing of the game beyond using the terms 'Resistance,' 'Spies,' and 'Missions.'"
• "It's a very fun game that really requires to lie very well and/or be good at detecting liars."
• "I just got 2 more for friends and family and if you like this game another great game in Coup."
• "It tends to get a bit stale if you play it too many times."
• "This game is so much fun with a group of people!"
• "Everyone who plays it loves it!"
• "Since bluffing is involved, it is a really good bonding game and usually has lots of laughs!"
• "original Resistance game came mostly with playing cards to represent everything--who the team leader is, who's going on the team, the voting indicators, and the mission pass/fail cards."
• "It’s always kind of tense and exciting."
• "Nobody knows who exactly played what card, that's where the trickery comes in."
• "If you like to bluff this is a game for you."
• "Each round, a different number of players are assigned to go on the mission depending on the number of players and the round number.<br"
• "(The spies won 3 times and the resistance won once!)"
• "If you can say you've played a board or party game that amount of times, I'd say you've got your money's worth.<br /><br />In"
• "tact, compassion and trickery to muster your cause to the forefront<br />Love the artwork.<br />I wouldn't use this as an icebreaker to meet new people but could work.<br /><br />Resistance!"
• "this mission was clearly a success."
• "The more players, the better."
• "I find myself playing 4+ games each time because it is so fun, but you get a new role each time.<br"
• "This is a party game, and there are a few things that every party game should do, and The Resistance does all of them well.<br />Firstly, the game has to be easy to learn, and it is."
• "The things you end up saying to and hearing from your friends is just hilarious and engaging."
• "It's easy to learn how to play which is really nice."
• "I highly recommend this to anyone that likes a thoughtful, smart game to play with friends."
• "You get to do thinks no matter whose turn it is as every motion and action you take is part of the game, which is why it can support so many players without being boring.<br /><br />Flaws:<br />-not greatly balanced<br />-plot"
• "It's easy to grasp and fast paced."
• "Fun for hard and soft core gamers alike.<br />**"
• "And always a hit to play at parties!"
• "It is a truly remarkable game of bluffing and counter-bluffing, and will keep you on your toes from beginning to end."
• "Easy yet resounding with strategy."

• "This game is very fun to play with your family, and friends as well."
• "If you like werewolf you might very well like this.<br />Not here to write a big review on it."
• "Fun for the entire family - seriously!"
• "The more lively and conniving the group the better."
• "Like poker, you play the players without all the statistics."
• "This game is very fun."
• "Not all surfaces will cause them to wear out, but it's good to watch out."
• "Game can be easy or get a little complicated."
• "/>Dialog between the players creates a more involved environment this can be either good or bad depending on your family and friends :)<br /><br />A minimum of 5 players is needed which can limit it's use but overall it's a really fun game!"
• "The Resistance lost and the Spies won."
• "The rules are extremely simple and you'll be second guessing the honesty your best friends and spouses the whole time."
• "Great game for larger groups."
• "This game is a lot of fun."
• "/>Only after a team has been accepted by the table do those team members vote for whether the mission succeeds or fails."
• "Be sure to enforce the rule that the mission success/fail cards are kept a secret."
• "It is very intense trying to identify the spies or trying not to be discovered as a spy."
• "#34;the spies always win&#34;, but even so this game is extremely fun; I have not yet played with the expansion cards (as it is recommended to game experience with the original game first) that make it easier for the loyalists to win; you can see another person's card, pick one person to show their card, show your vote first, etc."
• "/>Overall, highly recommend the product, and it always leads to a great time with lots of laughs and memories!"
• "Its not really a board game, but an interaction with friends."
• "This is a good game for a group of friends."
• "I first played this game at a friend's party and since then I have been hooked."
• "How not only none of your friends thought highly of you enough to think you were really on their side, but your other friends playing as spies had the gall to encourage everyone that obviously you had to be a spy.<br /><br />Bitterness will begin to enter your heart."
• "Anyone who has ever played a social game like Mafia or a deduction game like Clue will appreciate how The Resistance combines the social deception aspects of the former with genuine opportunities for deduction to create a unique gaming experience that gives an adrenaline-filled high every time."
• "The best thing about the Resistance is that it is very portable and you can play it where ever you are as long as you have 5 people and about 10 minutes of spare time."
• "There is also a version of this game called Resistance Avalon that has an Arthurian theme to it, whareas the original version has a more dsytopian future theme to it."
• "Anger and torment will be your only companions in the life ahead, mercilessly mocking you, reminding you of the friends and hope of a good life you once had."
• "it's easier to find the spies."
• "Resistance SHOULD BE better than basic Werewolf finger-pointing because you can analyze why certain people were chosen for a mission and how many people made it fail, etc."
• "The Resistance pits you and your friends against each other."
• "Very much enjoyed this game."
• "The Resistance allows a group an engaging time of deduction and manipulation."

• "But once you start playing, you understand it so much better and everyone loves it!"
• "I thought to myself (I have a good group of friends that would enjoy this game)."
• "I don't like when it is a several hour commitment to a game."
• "Can't ask for a better party game than that."
• "Personally, I wish an expansion to Avalon would be released, but The Resistance can be fun to switch up your games of Avalon."
• "Found this at a local game store but Amazon was cheaper"
• "Do you like to trick your friends?"
• "I think having 9 players with only 3 spies might be a bit better, but we'll see."
• "Not everyone participates in the mission (which is simply an anonymous vote to pass or fail) so selecting the teams is where the fun and excitement takes place.<br /><br"
• "This is a great role-playing game."
• "this game, play this game, weed out the spies and VIVA LA RESISTANCE!"
• "Definitely buy if you have at least 5 people you're comfortable yelling at. :)"
• "This is an inexpensive, portable, high quality, super replayable, quick party game that is about 3 things: Deception, Deduction, & Deduction."
• "In a ten player game, three adventure onward on the first mission and five set out on the fifth."
• "This game is a lot of fun as you try to figure out who are your friends and who are working against you."
• "/>It's the ultimate party game<br /><br />Buy"
• "This is a great social game to build friendships (after you tear them down and betray them while playing the game of course!) and have fun, memorable get-togethers."
• "Played this with a mix of experienced gamers and casual players and it was a hit."
• "and the game works just as well."

• "The good guys are totally in the dark."
• "Nice that it works for groups big and small."
• "Resistance is great because you stay in the game the whole time."
• "Need at least 5 people to play it, but it is great for bigger groups."
• "This game is *hard* to play because you need a lot of people to play it.<br /><br />I have seen thing game walk the dangerous line of a game becoming way too personal at times."
• "Maybe I just don't have very many friends, but getting 4 others together at the same time and willing to play can be challenging."
• "The number is dependent on how many total players are playing."
• "/>Shipping was very fast and it arrived in great condition."
• "I will play this on occasion because I don't want to be 'that guy' who doesn't want to play the game everyone else is playing."
• "Build confidence with other resistance, hunt down the spies and save the world!<br"
• "Three failed missions and the saboteurs win.<br />Great party game and needs more than 5 people to play."
• "Fantastic game to play with friends."
• "You can play the base game in Avalon as well if you so choose (simply ignore the effects of each character card and treat them as either spies or resistance).<br /><br />I purchased this and found out it was the third edition."
• "One of the best games ever"
• "I find this tends to slow the game and doesn't really add much value."
• "Play this game and find out.<br /><br"
• "/>But overall its a really well put together game."
• "I have played with gamers and non gamers a like"
• "Anyway, great game, definitely a keeper, just make sure you have some (relatively) patient players who are really into the gameplay and not just the yelling."
• "is great to play with 6 or more people, then the game becomes more and more funny and interesting.<br />Try"
• "Still, it's a great \\"who-done-it\\" game that will satisfy party gamers and serious gamers alike."
• "Wow, what a great game and an excellent price."
• "It makes you think, use a lot of analytic processing, while tricking your friends."
• "The ratio of spies to resistance is driven by the number of players in a game."
• "You don't have to be an extrovert to enjoy the game- a great deal of deception and communication can come from someone that isn't saying much at all."
• "Quick to play and easy to learn."
• "The best part is that it's a short game."
• "Easy to pick up quickly but challenging enough to have high replay value."
• "Seven players is the most fun."
• "This seems like it would be a fun game, and it is, but it doesn't always work out properly."
• "I had so much fun playing this game at the meeting that I take every chance I can to spread the good word of &#34;The Resistance.&#34;"
• "How much you enjoy it also depends largely on who you play with."
• "The game is short enough to play in a few spare minutes and but varies enough that it doesn't get old."
• "This version improves in every way how the game looks."
• "It is indeed another family favorite!"
• "You want to try to find the spies and convince people that you aren't a spy.<br />Note: If you play with less people (it's 5-10 players)"
• "The more the merrier with Resistance!"
• "It is a family game night favorite."
• "I've had many laughs and frustrations trying to figure who is on which side."
• "If you like this you should try Avalon."
• "Some people at the table are on the good Resistance team."

• "It's an intense battle of wits, highly recommended."
• "Therefore, if the leader picks a team in which there is a spy, the spy can easily play the &#34;failure&#34; card and the mission will fail since it only takes one &#34;fail&#34; card to fail the mission.<br"

• "I've never enjoyed Mafia because I never knew what to do or say or anything, and never really got the point."

• "Only disadvantage is that you have to have at least 5 players for a game."
• "one warning I have is this: the players need to be at least a little outspoken."

• "If the table votes and approves the team, that team then casts ballots to pass or fail a mission."
• "You will have a ton of fun arguing and trying to deduce who the loyal operatives are and who the evil spies are."
• "You can either sit silently by as the rest of the players confuse each other with misleading information, or you could be the persuasive one trying to mislead people yourself!"
• "e.g. you are all trying to get points, and the opposition gets to secretly make plays so that you lose points."
• "In the resistance, most players are members of the resistance, trying to take down the evil empire/corporation; the twist is that some of your fellow players are actually spies for the big bad guys."
• "It's a game of arguing."
• "Because a couple people in the game are secretly spies for the government, and want to get on the mission team in order to sabotage it."
• "The game is quick, very simple, and it really winds up when people stop trusting one another and start slinging accusations at the drop of a hat."
• "The reality is that there is so much table talk, with people yelling at one another and accusations flying wholesale that with the right crowd, the cops may be called by a neighbor."
• "/>If you never played this, BUY IT!"
• "/>It's a game where everyone cheats at some point and everyone has to call other people on cheating and lying and accuse their friends of being the bad guy."
• "This is one of those games that &#34;I&#34; find a lot if fun, but really pisses other people off."
• "I find this game incredibly frustrating."
• "/>Alas, I've been purging material goods lately, and Killer Bunnies and The Resistance now both have new, better homes."

Negative Features:

• "If you're a 4 year old boy it doesn't get much better than this!!"

• "It was annoying having to fix it every other use."
• "Not sure how long it will last."

• "Beware of nearby trees...they will get stuck!"
• "Lost them all for a couple of hours."
• "Maybe I will bring it back out tomorrow and just leave them with it outside, and see what happens."

• "the stand is horribly engineered and comes apart a lot."

• "The frame is a bit tough to snap together and you have to re-set it occasionaly, but its really simple."
• "BUT - the next day things began to fall apart - 2 rockets lost a fin, the screw holding the air tube to its post just would not stay tight and had to be retightened every other time a rocket was launched."
• "It doesn't affect the rocket launch though, so no big deal."

• "This is not the fist time I have ordered crap from Amazon."
• "It was missing the last leg (the 3rd) of the base."
• "No harm though...there's pretty much no way this toy can hurt anything or anyone."
• "Not a huge deal and you can always adjust it."
• "The build quality is as bad as it gets."
• "The new style ones are definitely more cheaply made in construction and the plastic is not as forgiving to accidental stomping misses."
• "Something about the destructive and primal stomping of the pad keeps them entertained for hours."

• "Three year old girl can launch with no problem."
• "If you are willing, you can even let them shoot it off in the house:)."
• "It only takes a second for them to destroy the rocket."

• "Durable enough to stomp on hard."
• "But no problem, I just screwed the leg with the launch tube to a piece of board and added some duct tape, all is well."
• "but I need to get more to avoid the constant fighting!"
• "and it's the $12 item that steals the show."
• "The bad thing: how many little blue tail fins can you find around the house?"
• "Not much fun to play with."
• "Appallingly, the packaging and the overall quality were such that the pieces in the box were broken on arrival (little broken yellow pieces of the \\"launchpad\\")."
• "Stomping as hard as you can and making the rockets fly.<br /><br"
• "With this toy, you LEARN that it takes 'x' amount of pressure of your foot to send the rocket 'y' number of feet into the air, and you LEARN that the rocket won't work well unless you set the rocket on the launcher 'just so.'"
• "These trees are not super tall, so when the rocket shoots up, sometimes its hard to see where it went (though most of the time it just goes straight up and straight back down)."
• "Let's the grandkids stomp and the rockets didn't disintegrate or get hopelessly lost.!!!"
• "The only complaint I have is that the feet can come apart, but I fixed that with a couple of zip ties."

• "It's cool as as you can shoot rocket, almost 24 feet high, no battery required."
• "You do have to adjust the blue tubing to get the kinks out or the rocket will not launch well."
• "Also recommend buying extra rockets when purchasing, because unless you're in a large, open field, you will lose rockets."
• "This is actually a second as a couple of his rockets have been damaged from landing on the roof and waiting for weather to bring them down."
• "The &#34;rockets&#34; are just sturdy enough to hit the ceiling but could in no way damage them."
• "The stand is almost laughable because of how flimsy it is and it doesn't stay together at all!!"
• "When adults stomped on it the rockets went over the house and were difficult to retrieve."
• "The two year old had a hard time stomping hard enough to make the rocket fly but the others had a ball...ended up chasing each other without the stand attached."

Negative Features:
• "set includes a high quality jacket, sturdy plastic hat, bullhorn, and plastic fire extinguisher."
• "Two minor complaints:<br /><br />He really wanted the fire extinguisher to do something... anything."
• "I was very surprised at the quality of this costume, I expected it to be thin and flimsy as most costumes<br />seem to be made lately, but I was very wrong."
• "BUT this item came with torn packaging!"
• "The bullhorn however is very noisy and annoying and there is no off switch."
• "Within one month one of the megaphones stopped working (we tried changing the batteries)."
• "It was  wearing out, so I had no concern about buying another."
• "You can't press the lever, no sounds, nothing.<br /><br"
• "The jacket is very high quality as are the accessories - fire extinguisher, bullhorn, helmet, ID and badge."
• "/>Melissa & Doug toys solve problems that other similar toys have.<br"
• "Didn't play with the mega phone too much though."
• "The helmet is okay, but it doesn't stay on well, and frequently gets discarded after a few moments of play."
• "The only thing I don't like about it is the Velcro loops on the sides of the jacket."
• "The only negative is the bullhorn."
• "And there's a velcro on the jacket to attach the fire extinguisher."
• "The fire extinguisher had no moving parts and the boys liked the hats without the sizing insert."
• "The bullhorn is rather annoying and the fire extinguisher isn't played with much."
• "Just a word of warning - that bullhorn looking thing comes with a REALLY loud siren sound."
• "all in all, it is worth $25, but the hat thing is annoying and don't expect it to stay on...."
• "Fire Extinguisher and Bullhorn attach to the coat on the velcro waist strap."
• "The other complaints have to do with the fire extinguisher doesn't stay in the Velcro strap very well."
• "But maybe that was supposed to be more for pretend."
• "Not like the cheap version at the Halloween stores."
• "WoooooOOOO, there's a fire, let's get to it!"
• "That is confusing however, since it opens and has an opening at the spout."
• "The outfit is adorable; came quickly in the mail with no damages."
• "So the youngest got this set and then the arguments continued because the hat to this suit plus the suit itself became the source now for many showdowns."
• "When I purchased this Fire Chief Costume, I was a bit concerned about what I was going to be getting because I have seen many costumes with very poor quality!"
• "The only adjustment his parents had to make was taking the battery out of the bull horn (it makes a very loud alarm sound)."
• "The jacket is durable and it comes with a lot of other devices that a fire officer uses."
• "I have ordered this TWICE, only for the bullhorn to arrive broken both times."
• "When you turn it on it blares this amazingly loud and annoying siren until it is turned off."
• "The only negative is that the jacket is not breathable at all."
• "The sticker on the fire extinguisher was also very cheap and came off the first time it was exposed to water."
• "I didn't put the batteries in right away and was sorry when I finally did."
• "no matter how you strap it in."
• "This is one costume that can be worn over and over or handed down."
• "I am a preschool teacher and have been looking for a non plastic fire fighter outfit!"
• "Has worn the coat and helmut around quite a bit pretending to put out little fires with the extinguisher."
• "No complaints on this outfit."
• "The inside of hat came apart and was hard to put back."
• "The blowhorn broke after 5 minutes."
• "On other products – if the straps get ripped out of the helmet there are sharp plastic edges left behind that can cut."
• "I was hesitant to purchase it without seeing it in person but I figured since it was Melissa & Doug the quality would be high end...and it is!"
• "The only caveat is that the screws were stripped on both of the megaphones, making it impossible to put in the batteries."
• "Never put batteries in the loudspeaker because the noise is just too annoying."
• "The bullhorn and the fire extinguisher are affixed to the coat with velcro straps, and the bullhorn sort of hooks onto the strap ok, but the fire extinguisher is VERY hard to wrap the strap around, I think because the strap is the exact circumference of the toy."
• "The toy bullhorn literally lasted an hour before it broke."
• "The fire extinguisher is long gone-"
• "It is made of quality material, and the hat is hard, not the cheap plastic."
• "I was worried about the size since the manufacturer recommends it for ages 3-7."
• "Might as well buy something washable instead of wasting $20 or more on a costume that'll break after one night!"
• "Even if your not thrilled with the toys, the jacket alone is well worth the price."
• "The other side for the bullhorn is awkward and doesn't hang quite right"
• "I accidentally broke the flimsy rubber strap inside the helmet trying to break it free from the vest (it is attached to the vest by a thick thread out of the box)."
• "The other firefighter costumes are more expensive and have no accessories except the helmet."
• "The label on the fire extinguisher was already off when I opened the box."
• "It doesn't even look like a costume at all."
• "On the Melissa & Doug fire helmet, the fitting straps on the inside are actually removable and there are no sharp edges at all.<br /><br"
• "Bullhorn was stuck and could not turn off."
• "Other than that, no complaints."
• "Bullhorn is cheaply made and fire extinguisher is dumb - it doesn't squirt or do anything."
• "The only complaint I have is the sizing ring that fits inside  the fire hat is a little bit cheaply made, poorly designed."
• "Quite embarrassing to give it as a present given its condition."
• "The hat fits weird, but so do most hard plastic hats that have the removable plastic webbing on the inside."
• "Basically it is useless and only to be used for pretend play."
• "The piece in the helmet that goes around your child's head keeps coming loose and falling out."
• "*Reason for 4-stars: it's missing the fire extinguisher**"
• "Unfortunately it does NOT actually function as a working bullhorn, which would have been MUCH better) and the \\"fire extinguisher\\" is not flimsy, neither is the plastic hat."
• "Ditto for the toys (pirate ship and fire station) and the puzzles."
• "The only downside to this set is this..."
• "The only reason it lost a a start was the hat."
• "The fire extinguisher sprays water as a squeeze bottle, but the nozzle was poorly constructed and sprays everywhere when sprayed."
• "Its hard to buy things online"
• "The jacket is well made and the helmet is a hard plastic (vs the cheap ones you get from the fire dept as a giveaway)."
• "Nothing like seeing your 2 year old dressed up like a little fireman."
• "The hat is a little flimsy and the toy horn is really loud and annoying."
• "The only reason didn't give it five stars is because of the Velcro straps that hold the bull horn and fire  extinguisher on."
• "You might just want to hide the bullhorn/siren before you give it to your kid..."
• "Older children would have no problem though."
• "I work in a pre-k daycare setting and know how hard children are on dress up clothes."
• "Fire extinguisher is flimsy, cap easily comes off, and is the weak point of the kit."
• "The bullhorn broke right away"
• "Also, other reviewers were correct about the inside of the hat falling out."
• "The megaphone is just as sturdy and I see there is a screw to open it for batteries, and a little push button."
• "Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from."
• "Good Quality, but poor design."
• "The only problem was the tiny screws on the bullhorn."
• "I think that will fix the problem."
• "Refused to take it off even when going to Grandma's house."

• "Sadly the seams are all coming undone."
• "The only complaint I have, I wish the fire extinguisher actually did something."
• "He's obsessed with anything fireman related."
• "The bottle lid cross threads and will not close securely."
• "Horn gets a little annoying but you can just take the batteries out."
• "The only slight disappointment was the megaphone - it has a button which creates a siren sound, but it doesn't actually work as a megaphone by amplifying the voice at all."
• "Feels durable, not like cheap plastic."
• "Great costume but pls use buttons instead because it destroys the costume overtime"
• "Megaphone has a siren that makes an irritating and loud cry, but that's what they're supposed to do, right?"
• "Not the best combination w/a 3 year old boy!"
• "Even the silk screened &#34;Fire Chief&#34; on the back of the jacket is done with quality...thick ink and no gaps in the silkscreen.<br /><br"
• "The most durable part of the whole set is the fire hat."
• "I did unscrew it & take it completely apart to superglue it back in place but that was a bit frustrating."
• "It is not worth paying the postage to return it."
• "Her only complaint is that it doesn't have pants, but that's obviously her personal thing, and something I'll probably remedy soon with a pair of red sweatpants or something."

• "and I don't think you will go wrong in purchasing this item."
• "press the green circle button with the boy on it making a scared face and it correlates to the ball on the \\"screen\\" in the same position and the computer says \\"i like bouncing the ball.\\" you press the red triangle with the baby crying and the bottle on the screen lights up, \\"i'm hungry.\\" they're just so stupid!<br"
• "I'm annoyed that this product was listed as a toy for a 6-month-old."
• "/>Though there appears to be no danger in her fingers getting injured, it is quite silly for the quality testers to not have noticed this flaw."

• "I wouldn't let him play with this one alone because I can easily see this hurting his little fingers."
• "As a parent, though, it's just hard to stomach!"

• "I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."
• "Light lightning bugs trapped behind painter's plastic."

• "When you turn it on, a very annoying song plays."
• "There's so much going on with this toy and I think the correspondence between the buttons and the icons on the \\"screen\\" are a bit confusing."
• "Within a few weeks of purchase the laptop developed a problem."
• "The issue I had was that the batteries it had were completely dead so I had to dig in and replace them."
• "That could drive a Grandma crazy!"
• "Another product I had from vtech had an electrical fire within."
• "i personally think all vtech toys are the most obnoxious brand out there, hands down."
• "I wasn't sure if it was too young for him."
• "No need to spend more on some of the more elaborate ones!"
• "However, as more people have pointed out, the lid of this slams shut, and has on several occasions hurt his fingers."
• "Really, come on you guys do you actually think than someone would pay that for this little toy?"
• "There are plenty of voices, sounds, and music to keep things from getting too repetitive."
• "Contrary to other reviews, I don't think it closes hard or can pinch their hands."

• "I don't even like to use the word \\"snap\\" as I wouldn't call it that."

• "Not very much to do but for that age the lighs and sound do the trick, on the laptop closes baby has hard time opening."
• "That was absolutely no problem."
• "A very nice fake laptop for babies."
• "/>Battery life so far is very good with the unit being used everyday for 3 weeks and no sign of weakness."
• "After a while of opening and closing, it starts to get weak from the spring that holds it down or up."
• "He's a tough little guy too"
• "Only problem is that not very many selections for learning."
• "Would that have been so hard?"
• "I would guess the typical 3yo would be a little bored w/ this toy."
• "but I see from other reviews that people purchased this to distract from your computer."
• "So, for an 18 month old, this doesn't do the best at entertaining him."
• "/>Oh, how I envy him and his simple laptop;  no investments, no news, no work emails, no etc.... just lights, music, and sound.<br /><br"
• "Although many reviewers are disappointed with the learning/educational value of this laptop, keep in mind it is a TOY."
• "I know, firsthand, this laptop took quite a bit of punishment in the form of drops, spilled liquids, and tantrums.<br /><br />Since"
• "This was not what I was hoping for."
• "The sond bad thing is you need to watch as childern may pinch their finger between the lid."

• "This is not the first V-tech toy we've had a problem with."
• "I personally think its LAME"
• "It automatically turns off after no one plays it for a while."
• "I don't think it'll break any fingers or do any real damage, but if they're not careful (and let's face it, babies are not trying to be careful)"
• "It really is not a good learning toy."
• "The one negative though is that one time, on closing, the lid did pinch his fingers."
• "You've got to figure no matter how durable something is, after 8 months of banging, drooling in, chewing on, and bending backwards, just about anything's going to have problems!"
• "I don't think a hand got slammed in it because the screen has always been fully open when I've noticed the crying."
• "It is very durable, though, so when I threw it in the dumpster it did not brake."
• "just the standard annoying, hit a button, you see flashing lights and hear obnoxious music with no particular rhyme or reason.<br /><br"
• "especially because after it lights up the \\"shape\\" one box at a time, it blinks and flashes and makes it go in an orbit motion, which just looks more confusing and random.<br"
• "You press the arrow button, you might get the word \\"arrow\\" or you might get a stupid song."
• "back to this one in particular though, it's just outright confusing."
• "It gets very confusing for the little minds, I guess."
• "Most children can find a way to hurt themselves with their toys and I don't think that the lid could ACTUALLY hurt her, but pinched and smashed fingers are inevitable.<br /><br"
• "I have had to tighten the screws for the screen a few times but thats it."
• "Battery life so far is very good with the unit being used everyday for 3 weeks and no sign of weakness."

• "this thing can also take a serious beating."
• "WARNING: this is a noisy toy, and there are a lot of different sounds and noises that it makes."
• "Very confusing to a toddler"
• "The good thing is that the toy still functions with no outward or inner signs of damage."
• "Some of the sounds that represent the pictures are not very clear and are difficult for a baby to understand."
• "It continuously seemed to get stuck or the buttons just didn't work."
• "In fact, the lights are so lackluster as to be a vague annoyance in the background."
• "Just not a very creative mix of functions for buttons."
• "Sometimes you only discover problems with certain products when you get them home."
• "already dancing and shaking his head to the tunes."
• "I guess even Amazon knows it's a dud."
• "We've had it for 3 months and it's still in perfect working condition, even after all the abuse!"
• "No damage to either finger or toy but something to look out for.<br"
• "Oh, how I envy him and his simple laptop;  no investments, no news, no work emails, no etc.... just lights, music, and sound."
• "I have not heard from the parents about this being good or bad."
• "press the green circle button with the boy on it making a scared face it and makes the screen light up in a circle shape, except because the screen is a square, the circle is just one box in the center of the top, sides, and bottom."
• "Pushing buttons isn't really fun for a 6 month old."
• "I really can't understand the popularity of this toy."
• "Took a lot of abuse."
• "I simply think there is no rhyme or reason to it and instead is just an overpriced light."
• "The singing voice is very repetitive and annoying as well."
• "/>It also has a mouse (a literal mouse no less!)"
• "but the quality is not very good the buttons come out quickly."
• "Then it just stopped working."
• "Also, if you don't take the time to turn this off after each use and it gets thrown in a toy basket or other storage space, the mouse is likely to get pushed around and the toy will continue blurting out annoying sounds at you until you turn off the power switch.<br /><br />All"
• "There is no rhyme or reason to the sounds it makes, the words it says, and the lights that it displays."
• "the images are hard to decipher"
• "The sound is clear enough, but not great."
• "i barely noticed what it was doing after sitting there for 10 minutes trying to make sense of this junk, let alone a baby won't get it."
• "This has happened a few times before (never anything serious, just enough pain to make him grouchy), so I suggest not leaving your little one alone with this, even then though, it's kind of a hard thing to prevent."
• "but it is just not engaging enough."
• "It now sits in the bottom of the toybox in the land of forgotten toys."
• "This baby laptop did the trick in keeping her mind and fingers busy."
• "Purchased in august didnt open till Christmas and doesnt work and cant return it very disappointed"
• "That's some mighty bad lyrics."
• "This one is sturdy, heavy plastic, doesn't tip over, good sound -- volume control for loud or soft -- and big buttons for babies and toddlers to discover on their own."

• "The only problem is keeping up with all the blocks."
• "I was concerned by the reviews of baby's arms getting caught in the block slot or the gap between the train and the ride-on section."
• "The side of the train also has a book and every time you turn the page the train tells you something about the letters on the page like \\"Q is for Quilt\\" or \\"M is for Monkey, can you find the block with the Monkey?\\""
• "Whoever created this product needs to be fired for over looking the block shoot on top of the train."
• "only negative is that it isn't nearly as educational as it is fun."
• "The only complaint is that the music cycles on....and on....and on...."
• "Feeling very disappointed that this toy didn't even make it a year."
• "The problem is that every block has two letters - oneon the front, and one on the back."
• "This is unacceptable for a multitude of obvious reasons.<br /><br"
• "only thing I don't like about this toy is the paper flaps that turn with the letters on it."
• "If you're inclined to OCD, keeping track of all 26 letter blocks may be a little overwhelming."

• "When you put the letter blocks in the slots, it sometimes says the wrong letter."
• "The only downfall to this toy is with the blocks."
• "The attached cart with seat is unsafe and does not ride well nor does it remain attached."
• "dangerous when baby climbs over and tries to stand on top of the wagon compartment because the train moves."
• "The one year old can stand up behind it without the wagon, but needs an adult right there since it doesn't seem steady enough to leave him and not be there to catch him if it falls over.<br />Not"
• "Adding the second \\"car\\" with the seat helps with stability (though not entirely), but that renders this useless as a walker for young toddlers.<br /><br"
• "As a kid, I would have been totally bored with a toy that does so much for me, but in today's techno-dominated society where all youngsters have to do is stick out their finger and push a button - this one has higher expectations."
• "After much research, I decided to get this toy despite some of the negative reviews."
• "I rushed over to him to find that his entire arm was lodged inside the shoot on top of the train that's meant for the alphabet blocks."
• "so I just keep the two pieces detached."
• "The thing I do not like is the song it is rather annoying!"

• "The wide angle photos don't give you true feel for how narrow it is."
• "It's supposed to say the letter on the block or the picture on the block, but we'd put in the \\"D\\" block and it would say \\"G is for Gift, G, G, G.\\""
• "The one part I could see possibly breaking if you're not careful is the connector between the seat and the main part but mainly if you were to pick up just one section and leave the other dangling."
• "I gave it four stars because I feel that the seat could cause an accident."
• "There is no volume control option and this is a problem for us."
• "Seriously, if noisy toys annoy you, do not get it."
• "The blocks go in the slot and shoot out the back."

• "This toy is outrageously overpriced."
• "The blocks can be placed on the train's side and then the computer will talk about the block."

• "The front part contains a chute at the top and if you put a block in the chute it shoots out into the little compartment under the attached seat."
• "(Some toys have OBNOXIOUS voices; thankfully, this isn't one of those.)<br /><br"
• "and it's no problem, babies fall over all the time anyway."
• "There is just so much to keep him busy and challenged."
• "Lol...the train also teaches letter recognition by prompting you to find the letter blocks that coincide with the letters on the page of the book and place them in the compartment next to the correct letter."
• "Sad part is this is an Alphabet Train and you can't even spell Train..."
• "Not sure if letters are randomly placed on the back of each other or it is fixed (example L is on the other side of Y)."
• "The new design has fewer letter blocks, because multiple letters are on each one."
• "At the top of the train there is a shoot where you can put in your letters and it shoots into the caboose (I guess that's what you could call it.)"
• "26 blocks of letters, a train that's detachable for babies at different stage."
• "When she's not pushing it or riding on it, she's chewing on the blocks, putting the blocks in the train or playing with the book or buttons."
• "/>However, half of the point of this toy is supposed to be learning letters, and in this regard it is literally one of the worst educational toys I've EVER seen.<br"

• "I've taught her how to put the blocks into the top and watch them come out the back into the attached caboose, although I do sometimes find other random objects stuck in there."
• "Any movement or touching at all will cause this thing to go into a blaring 2 minute solid noise festival of hell."
• "The one thing I wish it did have was a regular volume knob instead of a switch to just pick between the two volumes as even the lower volume can get annoying at times with the repetitiveness."
• "AWESOME!)and you must use both hands to lift the toy otherwise you will stress the plastic connector between the train and car."
• "I was so eager to buy it but when I brought it home and opened the box, it was nothing special."
• "The hard plastic wheels are kind of lame."

• "The music can grate your nerves but that's why the OFF switch is so invaluable."
• "The one thing bad about this product is it is too light weight for the standing position."
• "and i hate spending money on a toy that doesn't keep their attention which happens most of the time."
• "It's also difficult for him to ride the train because it's two separate pieces and the handle sits too far forward."
• "Now he's a lot better with balance at 18 months, but the thing is still too narrow.<br />Third, the train is not designed well for riding at all."

• "The walker part of this is a little unstable for beginner walkers."
• "If you think about it, any toy can be dangerous if not used properly and with proper supervision."

• "I paid $50 for this toy, and in hindsight, would pay even more."
• "But, it's not only her who was so crazy about the toy, but also her 6 and 4 year old sisters."
• "The only thing I don't like as much about it is that the train doesn't turn very well, but no problem for a toddler to lift to change direction."
• "The music is fun and catchy but not in the annoying, stuck in your head, please put an end to this misery type of way."
• "Not a very happy mom..."
• "All you have to do is touch it and it cycles through about 2 minutes of automated songs, \\"educational\\" instructions to the child, more songs, some very annoying interlude, and then the same song again - without any further input from the kid."
• "It is very awkward to &#34;ride&#34; since the two pieces are separate."

• "Purchased this at a steal during the holiday sale."
• "So half the time you have to basically turn over all of the blocks to find the letter you want.<br /><br"
• "All-in-all, I'd say this:  There is no substitution for parental supervision....ever."
• "For the amount of money you pay it is not exceptional."
• "The other reviewers are spot on, this is not the best walker out there."
• "The labels on the blocks don't hold up very well to a teething child, and the toy sometimes gets the letters wrong (!)"
• "Is vtech just intentionally trying to make parents lose their minds?"
• "It incorrectly recognized a lot of blocks."
• "Opened the box, saw how narrow and unstable it would probably be, plus it had a hole that a child's arm might get caught in."
• "I gave this 1 star and would give 0 if I could because it came in severely damaged package with 90% of pieces missing."
• "If I could go back in time, I'd never buy this stupid train.s usability, the alphabet recognition is really the only thing that the toy has accomplished."
• "This product was a little smaller than expected and hard for an 18 month old to sit on and push."
• "That is wrong in so many ways.<br /><br"
• "While for most letters that is not an issue, when you put the K in the train you get \\"K is for kite, K! K! K!\\", which people with wafer-thin sensibilities might find offensive."
• "Vtech, you need to go back to including all 26 blocks!"
• "The Grandparent who purchased this item even commented as to how noisy it was for no good reason and turns off the sound (this Grandparent also frequently fails to have their hearing aids in/on."
• "The Leapfrog is easier to roll than the Vtech but still not as easy as the Fisher Price Ride On or Little Tikes."
• "In addition the song sings itself over and over with no prompting and can drive you crazy."
• "Learn to walk, and was distracted when fell by the alphabet blocks."
• "Turning the pages in the book is very fragile, and the sensors are often wrong, reading the *wrong* page out of the book."
• "I guess I have one other negative, it is loud."
• "Unfortunately it arrived not working."
• "One note to the manufacturer, since you've used a binary coding scheme to tag the blocks, why not also include the numbers 1-10 in the block set?"
• "The front part has all the bells and whistles and has a handle and the back part is a seat with an empty compartment underneath."
• "It's not like other walkers in the fact that the wheels turn to quickly for a prewalker."
• "Since the handle bar to the train is at the very back, it is hard for him to walk around with just the train part itself."
• "/>Reading through the reviews I was amazed that no one was complaining about the slight racist slip up, of repeating each letter three times after inserting into the slots."
• "It teaches words, colors, letters, songs, is interactive, can identify the letter on the blocks you put into it and says a word with that letter."
• "The only negative is that there are only activites on one side of the train."
• "I will use this for the learning tools but unfortunately I have to purchase another balancing walker."
• "The only note is that since the seat and the train are coupled together, it's not as easy a toy to scoot on as one of those little plastic riding cars, but it's still good.<br /><br"
• "When I contacted them about this I got no response."
• "I give it 1 star simply for it's poor design that would allow them to rate it for a 1 year old when an 18 month old can get so severely stuck in it."
• "I was not going to get this because I had read all the reviews on babies getting stuck between the two pieces."
• "This thing is a steam calliope more than enough bells and whistles to drive you insane."
• "/>And it gets even worse: when you put the block where it's supposed to snap into the train, the sensors sometimes read it wrong."

• "The air valves are difficult to use to pump air<br />2."

• "Very disappointing and inconvenient as now I have to send it back."
• "The air nozzles to inflate the rings are kind of a pain to squeeze and blow into."

• "I wonder if anyone else had this problem."
• "It also is a little difficult to get the babies in and out, but not excessively so."

• "Because it is not durable, it may not be safe."
• "but somewhat unhappy with the 'roof'-pretty flimsy."
• "I got out and tried to re-inflate and close the chamber and it happened again so there must be a leak somewhere."
• "Only issue is the top doesn't seem to like staying up!!!"
• "Got one from the bad batch(es) - valve was sealed shut, as others had indicated."
• "Canopy is adjustable to keep sun off baby no matter what angle is needed."
• "It's a bit hard to get them in and out of it...but that's what husband's are there for!"
• "Too stressful for me, so It was easier to just hold her."
• "In addition to trouble holding air, the canopy was also a bit unwieldy."
• "Only bad part is deflating the raft, but you have that problem with all inflatable toys."

• "From reviews, it seems this product is hit or miss."

• "Extremely difficult to inflate and the 15 month old baby who weighs 17 lbs barely floated high enough out of the water."
• "but it was so hard to deflate that I gave up and tossed it in the trash."
• "Only negative is that you can't select your color."
• "I am optimistic that the product is excellent in terms of functionality, but getting an undesirable color (even though it was a disclaimer) is disheartening."
• "Deflating is a little obnoxious - you almost have to fold it up a bit and then squeeze the valve while squishing it to get the air out."
• "The recommended age is 9 months so I suspected as much."
• "Didn't really want blue and red for a girl, but hey, it works and cost less than if you buy the exact same one and get to pick your colors."
• "Too lazy to send back."

• "This was the first time I've ever received a new product from Amazon that was missing a piece"
